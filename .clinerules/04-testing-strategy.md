# Moo Climate Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy

For this data-intensive platform, our testing strategy prioritizes:

1. **Data Integrity** - Ensuring accurate collection, processing, and presentation of climate funding data
2. **User Experience** - Validating that the interface is intuitive and responsive for our target users
3. **System Reliability** - Confirming the platform operates consistently under various conditions
4. **Security** - Protecting sensitive user and financial data

## Testing Layers

### Frontend Testing

#### Component Testing

- Use **React Testing Library** for component tests
- Test all UI components in isolation with mock data
- Verify responsive behavior across device sizes
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

#### Integration Testing

- Test page compositions with component interactions
- Validate form submissions and error handling
- Test data filtering and search functionality
- Verify chart rendering with various data sets

#### End-to-End Testing

- Use **Cypress** for critical user flows
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate dashboard interactions and filtering
- Test data export functionality

### Backend Testing

#### Unit Testing

- Use **pytest** for Python backend testing
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

#### API Testing

- Test all API endpoints with various inputs
- Verify correct status codes and response formats
- Test authentication and authorization rules
- Validate rate limiting and error handling

#### Data Pipeline Testing

- Test each scraper module independently
- Validate data transformation and cleaning logic
- Test NLP classification accuracy
- Verify idempotency of pipeline operations

## Testing Environments

1. **Local Development** - Developers run tests locally before committing
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated tests run on each pull request
3. **Staging** - Full test suite runs before deployment to production
4. **Production** - Smoke tests run after deployment

## Test Data Management

- Maintain a set of representative test fixtures
- Use anonymized production data for complex scenarios
- Create specific edge cases for error handling
- Document test data assumptions and limitations

## Performance Testing

- Benchmark API response times under various loads
- Test dashboard rendering with large datasets
- Validate search performance with complex queries
- Monitor memory usage during data processing

## Security Testing

- Implement input validation tests
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Verify proper authentication and authorization
- Test data encryption and privacy controls

## Brand Consistency Testing

- Verify UI components use the correct brand colors (#F7D774, #2E5E4E, #2D2D2D, #F3F3F3, #FFFFFF)
- Validate typography follows brand guidelines (Inter/Poppins fonts, correct sizes and weights)
- Ensure UI elements match brand specifications (rounded corners, pill-shaped buttons)
- Test that iconography follows the minimal line style (Lucide/Feather)
- Verify color usage follows brand rules (Yellow for actions, Green for climate tags, etc.)

## Common Testing Pitfalls

1. **Brittle UI Tests** - Avoid testing implementation details; focus on user behavior
2. **Slow Test Suites** - Keep tests fast to encourage frequent running
3. **Flaky Tests** - Eliminate non-deterministic behavior in tests
4. **Inadequate Coverage** - Ensure critical paths and edge cases are tested
5. **Outdated Test Data** - Keep test fixtures in sync with schema changes
