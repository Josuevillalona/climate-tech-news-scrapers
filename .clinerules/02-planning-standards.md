# Moo Climate Planning Standards

## Task Breakdown Methodology

### Phase-Based Planning

For this full-stack data intelligence platform, all work should be broken down into these sequential phases:

1. **Foundation & API Contract** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Repository setup (frontend, backend)
   - API contract definition using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Database schema design
   - Authentication system implementation

2. **Parallel Development** (Weeks 5-10)
   - Frontend: UI components with mock data
   - Backend: Data pipeline and processing

3. **Integration & Deployment** (Weeks 11-18)
   - Connect frontend to live backend
   - Analytics implementation
   - Testing and optimization
   - Deployment configuration

### Task Granularity Guidelines

- Break down tasks to be completable in 1-2 days
- Each task should have a clear, testable outcome
- Frontend tasks should include design reference and responsive requirements
- Backend tasks should specify input/output contracts and error handling
- Data pipeline tasks should include validation criteria

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Extra Planning

1. **Data Quality & Coverage**
   - Plan for data validation and cleaning steps
   - Include fallback sources for critical data points
   - Define clear quality metrics and monitoring

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Identify potential bottlenecks in data processing pipeline
   - Plan for pagination and lazy loading in data-heavy UI components
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Create detailed integration test plans for frontend-backend connections
   - Document API versioning strategy
   - Plan for graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Sprint Planning Guidelines

- Maintain balance between frontend and backend tasks
- Include at least one high-value user-facing feature per sprint
- Allocate time for technical debt and documentation
- Plan for regular integration points between frontend and backend

### Brand Consistency Planning

- Ensure all UI components follow the brand color palette and typography guidelines
- Plan for design review checkpoints to validate brand consistency
- Include time for implementing brand-specific UI elements (cards, buttons, charts)
- Consider accessibility requirements while maintaining brand identity
