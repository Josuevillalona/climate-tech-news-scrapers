✅ **Data Extraction**: Structured parsing of company name, description, sector from table rows  
✅ **Quality Validation**: Skip non-company entries, clean text formatting, sector classification  
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust pagination detection, graceful fallbacks, comprehensive logging  
✅ **Storage System**: JSON fallback when database unavailable, structured data format  

## 🚀 Framework Scalability

The technical foundation supports easy expansion:
- **Modular Architecture**: VCPortfolioScraper base class with company-specific inheritance
- **Proven Pattern**: BEV scraper success validates approach for other VC firms
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Orchestrator system ready for multiple discovery sources
- **Database Ready**: Schema adapter integration for production deployment

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Pagination Critical**: Many VC sites paginate portfolio companies - need to handle this
2. **Table Structure**: Modern VC sites use structured tables vs simple div layouts
3. **Quality Filtering**: Essential to validate company names and skip UI elements
